# python-data-analysis-battles

This code loads and preprocesses the Fictional Character Battle Outcome Prediction dataset, then uses Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classification models to predict the battle outcomes. The models are tested on a split test dataset, and accuracy and performance metrics are calculated for each model to evaluate their effectiveness.
